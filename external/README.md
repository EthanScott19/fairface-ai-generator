# External
This is where we cloned the original Authors' Github repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Purdue-M2/AI-Face-FairnessBench.git
```
within the original authors' repository we made a directory called 'metadata' where we placed the annotation files test_data.csv and train_data.csv

To receive these files you must make a request to the authors of the paper.
