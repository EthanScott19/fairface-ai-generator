# FairFace Generator

Fairness aware face generative model using AI-Face

## Overview
This project is based off of the CVPR paper titled **"AI-Face: A Million-Scale Demographically Annotated AI-Generated Face Dataset
and Fairness Benchmark"**. The focus in this project is generation rather than detection.

The original paper studies how well different detectors are able to detect faces across different demographics (race, age, gender, etc.) In this project we are using the AI-Face dataset to generate faces and will be borrowing their metrics to evaluate how balanced the outputs are

**Our  question:**
>Does traininga generative model on a demographically annotated, diverse dataset lead to more balanced and fair face generation across different demographics?
